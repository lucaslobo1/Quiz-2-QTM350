# Life Expectancy and Population Page

Included is a scatterplot (and supporting code) showing the relationship between population and life expectancy. There seems to be a weak, positive correlation. Further analysis, included log-transforming some variables, may reveal added information, because some select countries have population sizes many standard deviations above the median.

After computing this directly, we find that the correlation between life Expectancy and population (in millions) is 0.0650, which is positive but definitely weak.

```{python}
#| echo: false

# Install packages
# !pip install pandas gapminder

# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from gapminder import gapminder

# Rename 'lifeExp' to 'life_expectancy' and 'gdpPercap' to 'gdp_per_capita'
gapminder = gapminder.rename(columns={'lifeExp': 'life_expectancy',
                                      'pop': 'population_millions', 
                                      'gdpPercap': 'gdp_per_capita'})

# Convert population to millions
gapminder['population_millions'] = gapminder['population_millions'] / 1_000_000

# Create a new pandas DataFrame from the modified gapminder data
gapminder_df = pd.DataFrame(gapminder)

# Save the DataFrame as a CSV file
gapminder_df.to_csv('gapminder.csv', index=False)
```


```{python}
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plotting
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
sns.scatterplot(data=gapminder, x="life_expectancy", y="population_millions")
plt.title("Population (in millions) vs. Life Expectancy")
plt.xlabel("Life Expectancy")
plt.ylabel("Population (millions)")
plt.show()

# Correlation coefficient.

coeff = gapminder[['life_expectancy', 'population_millions']].corr().iloc[0, 1]
print(f"Correlation between Life Expectancy and Population (in millions): {coeff:.4f}")
